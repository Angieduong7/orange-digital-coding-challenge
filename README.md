## After cloning down

### Install dependencies

In your terminal after you clone your project down, remember to run either `yarn` or `npm install` to build all the dependencies in the project.

### Start up the project

- Run `npm run startServer` or `yarn run startServer` to start up the server at port 8000 first
- Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to run the client side

Notes:

- All the data in the client side would be populated from the server with JSON format
- All the data is contained in the `data.ts` file
